CO₂ Emissions Prediction Using Linear and Ridge Regression

This project applies Linear Regression and Ridge Regression to predict CO₂ emissions(g/km) of vehicles using a real-world Canadian vehicle dataset. The objective is to model how vehicle characteristics and categorical attributes influence emissions, and to compare standard linear regression with a regularized approach.
The project emphasizes:
- Proper preprocessing of categorical data
- Model comparison using evaluation metrics
- Visual interpretation of predictions

Source: CO₂ Emissions by Vehicles – Canada (Kaggle)
Target Variable:CO2 Emissions(g/km)

Key Features Used:
- Engine size, cylinders, fuel consumption
- Vehicle make
- Vehicle class
- Fuel type
Categorical features are encoded using one-hot encoding.
Loaded dataset using pandas
One-hot encoded categorical variables:
- Make
- Vehicle Class
- Fuel Type
Removed leakage-prone and redundant columns such as:
- Fuel consumption metrics
- Model name
- Transmission

Split data into:70% training, 30% testing

Models Implemented
Linear Regression - A baseline regression model trained using ordinary least squares to predict CO₂ emissions.
Ridge Regression - A regularized linear model using L2 penalty to reduce coefficient magnitude and improve stability in the presence of multicollinearity.

Models were evaluated on the test set using:
R² score (goodness of fit)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Results
Linear Regression	
R² ~ 0.96	
RMSE ~ 12
Ridge Regression	
R² ~ 0.96
RMSE ~ 12

Both models perform similarly, with Ridge Regression offering improved coefficient regularization. Two plots were generated to assess model performance:
Linear Regression: Actual vs Predicted CO₂ Emissions
Ridge Regression: Actual vs Predicted CO₂ Emissions

Each plot compares predicted values against actual emissions, with a reference diagonal indicating perfect predictions.
