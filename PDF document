This report presents an introductory study of greenhouse gas emissions and their analysis using statistical and machine learning models, carried out as part of the WIDS project.

1. Background: Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change
 Greenhouse gases (GHGs) play a crucial role in regulating Earth’s temperature. However, anthropogenic emissions have significantly altered their natural balance, leading to global warming and climate change. Major Greenhouse Gases: 

Carbon Dioxide (CO2) – Contributes roughly 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Its primary sources include fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, deforestation, and biological respiration. CO2 is naturally sequestered through the biological carbon cycle via plants.  
Methane (CH4) – Accounts for approximately 11% of emissions. Major sources include livestock, agricultural practices, fossil fuel transport, and decomposition of organic waste in landfills. • Nitrous Oxide (N2O) – Makes up around 6% of emissions, largely originating from agricultural soil management, fossil fuel combustion, and wastewater treatment. 
Fluorinated Gases – Though only about 3%, these gases have very high global warming potential. They are used in refrigeration, air conditioning, and industrial applications.

2. Emission Measurement and Inventories 

Greenhouse gas concentrations are measured in parts per million (ppm) or parts per trillion (ppt). Due to their long atmospheric lifetimes, these gases become well-mixed globally, making their impact widespread. 
The concept of Global Warming Potential (GWP) allows comparison between gases by quantifying how much heat a given gas traps relative to CO2 over a standard 100-year period. An Emission Inventory is a systematic accounting of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere over a specific region and time period. These inventories are essential for climate modeling and policy making. 
High-quality inventories must be complete, consistent, transparent, comparable, and accurate. They are used by governments and scientists to track progress toward emission reduction targets.

3. Process Data Analytics 
Process data analytics is the analysis of data generated by industrial or chemical processes to: Understand behavior, Improve efficiency, Reduce emissions, Detect anomalies

Three standard chemical/industrial processes with clear CO₂ emission sources. These are widely :
a. Cement Manufacturing
Primary emission sources:
Calcination reaction
CaCO3 - CaO + CO2
 (process emissions — unavoidable)
Fuel combustion in kilns (coal, petcoke, gas)
Key variables: Kiln temperature, Fuel consumption, Clinker production rate, Limestone feed rate

b. Iron & Steel Production (Blast Furnace Route)
Primary emission sources:
Coke combustion for heat
Chemical reduction of iron ore using carbon monoxide
Key variables: Coke consumption, Iron ore input, Furnace temperature, Hot metal output

c. Ammonia Production (Haber–Bosch Process)
Primary emission sources:
Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)
 CH4 + H2O - CO + 3H2
Water-gas shift reaction producing CO₂
Key variables: Natural gas consumption, Reforming temperature, Hydrogen yield, Ammonia output

3. Linear Regression: Theory and Interpretation 
Linear regression is a foundational statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. 
The distance between a data point and the fitted regression line is known as the residual. The sum of squared residuals (SS) is minimized to obtain the best-fit line. 
R² (Coefficient of Determination) represents the fraction of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. For example, an R² of 0.6 implies that 60% of the variation is explained by the model. 
P-values assess the statistical significance of the model. In regression, the p-value for R² is derived from the F-statistic, which compares explained variance to unexplained variance.

4. Ridge Regression and Regularization
Ridge regression is a regularized version of linear regression that introduces a penalty on the magnitude of coefficients to reduce overfitting. The ridge regression objective minimizes the sum of squared residuals plus a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficients, controlled by a hyperparameter λ (lambda). This technique introduces a small bias but significantly reduces variance, leading to better generalization on unseen data. It is particularly effective when dealing with multicollinearity or limited data.
